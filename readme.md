This is my practice assignment1 repository
It contains a program to print 1 to 10 in R and python

The assignment asks the following:

Create a GitHub repository called “assignment_1” that includes:
1. a readme.md file with a short markdown description of this assignment
2. a folder called “r_studio” with a R-studio project containing an R script that prints all integers between 1 and 10 (including 1 and 10) to screen
3. a folder called “spyder” with a Spyder project containing a Python script that prints all integers between 1 and 10 (including 1 and 10) to screen
4. A R Markdown file and a Jupyter notebook with a few introductory markdown comments and cells with the code from parts 2 (R) and 3 (Python) of this assignment. Also, the two html files generated by the R Markdown and Jupyter notebook.
